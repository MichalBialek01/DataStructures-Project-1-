## Testing Code for Data Structure Implementation
The above code represents the implementation of the following data structures:

Singly Linked List (SingleLinkedList)
Doubly Linked List (DoubleLinkedList)
Dynamic Array (Dynamic Array)
In the main class, you will find:

A runtime menu used to create objects and perform tests for each structure.
3 methods responsible for testing individual structures:
testIntSLL - method testing singly linked list
testIntDLL - method testing doubly linked list
testDA - method testing dynamic array
Helper methods:
printOperationTime - method for printing to the console
timeCountLogger - method responsible for logging to a CSV file, in the 'data' folder
Initially, conceptually, the code should test structures on the following data types:

Research on structure methods, in most cases, involves the cost of iterating for loops, resulting in a notation of O(n).

Based on the measurement results, charts of individual operations for the given data structures were created. All theoretical knowledge as well as measurement charts are included in the report: [Sprawozdanie.pdf](https://github.com/MichalBialek01/DataStructuresTest/blob/master/DataStructures_report.pdf)
